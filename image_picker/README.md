I am just a freshman IT student of an online course. However, this is the second programming language I've learn after C++. While most of knowledge about Flutter thanks to crash a class at school a month ago. 
Because the way we can create app with intuitive user interface and huge benefit when just write one but all compatibility.
Hence, definitely Flutter will be the main programming language I aim to approach comprehensively in the coming period with bigger project.
